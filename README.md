# Overview:
This program that plays a “hi-low” number guessing game. 

# Description:
* The program starts by generating a random number hidden from the user that is between 0 and 100.
* The user then attempts to guess the number, getting hints as to which direction (bigger or smaller, higher or lower) to go on 
the next guess.

# Conclusion:
The game can end in one of two ways:
* The user can correctly guess the number.
* The user can quit playing by entering a number out of the range of 0–100.
